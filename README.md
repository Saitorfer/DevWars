Hello!

DevWars its just a simple video game in Elm.
It's a little battle between programming languages.
First, you can select your language between five options.
After that, you can select an attack, and the first one to reduce the opponent's health to 0 wins.

You play against a machine, and the machine will randomly select one of its attacks and use it against you.

This little project is a practice to prove to myself that I know how to use Elm's navigation and ports. 

How can I play?

First you need to install elm in your computer.
Open the project with visual studio code.
Execute in the terminal the commands :
1) npm run compile (to generate the index.js)
2) npm run dev (to launch the project)
3) Enjoy the game
